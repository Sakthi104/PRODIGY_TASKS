            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The word calisthenics comes from the ancient Greek words kállos (κάλλος), which means "beauty," 
                and sthenos (σθένος), meaning "strength." It is the art of using one's body weight as resistance to develop physique.</p>
            <p>Calisthenics can be used as a means to pursue a number of fitness goals including, but not limited to hypertrophy (increasing one's muscle mass), strength, and endurance.<br>

                The training methods employed are often different, depending on the goal. For instance, when pursuing hypertrophy, one aims to increase the load volume over time; when pursuing strength, 
                the intensity of the exercise is increased over time; and to improve endurance, one can gradually shorten their rest periods.</p>

                <div id="exs">
                    <div class="exs" id="push-ups"><div><h3>Push-ups</h3><p>Performed face down on the floor, palms against the floor under the shoulders, toes <br>curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a <br>straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to <br>nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on the floor. This exercise<br> trains the chest, shoulders, and triceps. An easier version of this exercise consists of <br>placing the hands on a wall and then bending and straightening the arms.</p></div><div><img src="pushup.gif"></div></div>
                    <div class="exs" id="pull-ups"><div><h3>Pull-ups</h3><p>For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their<br> body up, chin level with the bar, keeping their back straight throughout the exercise. <br>The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to <br>starting position in a slow, controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats, and secondary<br> muscles working are upper back muscles, as well as the forearms and core muscles.</p></div><div><img src="pullups.gif"></div></div><br>
                    <div class="exs" id="squats"><div><h3>Squats</h3><p>Standing with the feet a shoulder-width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs <br>are parallel with the floor; during this action, they move their arms forwards in front of<br> them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides.<br>Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, gluteal muscles, and core. The height of the<br> squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level.</p></div><div><img src="squat.gif"></div></div><br>
                    <div class="exs" id="dips"><div><h3>Dips</h3><p>Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. <br>Feet are crossed, with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line <br>with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without <br>locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and deltoids, especially the <br>anterior portion.</p></div><div><img src="dips.webp"></div></div>
                    <div class="exs" id="plank"><div><h3>Plank</h3><p>The plank (also called a front hold, hover, or abdominal bridge) is an isometric core <br>exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push-up for the maximum <br>possible time. The most common plank is the forearm plank which is held in a<br> push-up-like position, with the body's weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes.<br> Many variations exist such as the side plank and the reverse plank.</p></div><div><img src="plank.gif"></div></div><br>
                    <div class="exs" id="sit-ups"><div><h3>Sit-ups</h3><p>A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move <br>their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to <br>the start position. For people who find it difficult to get down onto the ground, a <br>similar range of motion can be achieved by standing with the legs slightly bent, <br>and then bowing slightly and straightening up again.</p></div><div><img src="sit-up.gif"></div></div>
                    <div class="exs" id="muscle-ups"><div><h3>Muscle-ups</h3><p>The muscle-up (also known as a muscleup) is an advanced strength training <br>exercise, within the domain of calisthenics. It is a combination routine of a <br>radial pull-up followed by a dip. Variations exist for the rings as well as the <br>bar. The muscle-up begins with the arms extended above the head, gripping<br> a hold in the overhand pull-up position. The hold is usually on a chin-up bar <br>or gymnastic rings.</p></div><div><img src="muscle-ups.gif"></div></div>
                    <div class="exs" id="leg-raise"><div><h3>Leg-raise</h3><p>The leg raise is a strength training exercise which targets the iliopsoas <br>(the anterior hip flexors). Because the abdominal muscles are used<br> isometrically to stabilize the body during the motion, leg raises are <br>also often used to strengthen the rectus abdominis muscle and the <br>internal and external oblique muscles.</p></div><div><img src="leg-raises.gif"></div></div>
                    <div class="exs" id="burpees"><div><h3>Burpees</h3><p>A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, <br>arms, legs, and some parts of the back. The subject squats down and <br>quickly moves their arms and legs into a push-up position. Sometimes,<br> people do a push up (not mandatory) before they finish their rep by <br>tucking the legs in and jumping up.</p></div><div><img src="burpees.gif"></div></div><br><br>
